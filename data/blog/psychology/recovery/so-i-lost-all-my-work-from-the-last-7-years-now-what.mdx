# The Loss

Some people lost their entire wealth all of a sudden. Sometimes things happen that we cannot control. Well, I lost both; the wealth and the work that I have struggled with for the last 7 years. 

I became hopeless, nothing I can do to restore my work but my wealth will be restored with additional cherries on top. Though it hurts. It is painful, and it is killing me inside. I feel like I became worthless since my work defined me, and it is not just professional work-related. All of my art is gone as well. I have been creating for myself, and that's probably my biggest mistake. I haven't shared any of it. 

I have been trying to think of all the things that I have developed, researched, and created in the last 7 years and it is not an enjoyable memory lane to walk. I thought I will be able to recover some files using some apps, but there was nothing worth restoring from these apps. 

Now that we established the situation and we are back to zero, what do I do to recover? I am a little below zero with debt over $280k+. We got some type of fun here.

# The Recovery Plan

Since I lost everything, I guess I have everything to gain from here on. It is a matter of marketing myself and my projects. After 48 hours of this incident, I seem to have no plan on how to come back, but that's alright. 

The reason behind writing this article is to establish an understanding and be able to craft a strategy that would help me recover as fast as possible since my situation is critical. 

I will pour everything out and wear my heart on my sleeves. A lot of corrections will follow up in later blogs.

I have 3 core projects that I want to release. So let me cut through the noise and focus on them.

# Let the journey begin.


My only goal is to create as much content as possible to vent and attract. It is a simple strategy but requires a lot of energy. Luckily, I have a lot on my mind that weighs me down, but the more I write, the better I feel.
Time to let go of everything and start a new chapter in my life,  only this time, I won't be doing it all alone, moving away from introversion into extroversion.
I'm excited despite my losses. 

There is an inner feeling that things will be better than ever.


I will see you on the other side.
