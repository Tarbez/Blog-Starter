# The Loss

Some people might have lost their wealth all of a sudden because of something that was not in their control. For me I lost both, the wealth and my work that I have struggled for the last 7 years and I became hopeless, nothing I can do to restore my work but my wealth will be restored with additional cherries on top. Though it hurts... It is painful. It is killing me inside. I feel like I became worthless since my work defined me, and it is not just the professional work related, all of my art as-well. I have been creating for myself and that was probably my biggest mistake. I haven't shared any of it. I have been trying to think of all the things that I have developed, researched, and created in the last 7 years and it is not a enjoyable place to visit. I thought, I would be able to recover some files using some apps but all I got is system files and things that I didn't even matters. So now that we established the situation and we are back to zero, what can we or I do to recover. Actually I am a little below then zero with debt over $280k.
Fun Fun Fun.

# The Recovery Plan

Since I lost everything then I have everything to gain and it is simply a matter of marketing myself and my projects. After 48 hours of this incident, I seem to have no plan on how to come back but I will like to craft a strategy as I write this piece as I pour everything out and then will follow up with the corrections in later blogs.

I have 3 core projects that I want to release. So let me cut through the noise and focus on them.
